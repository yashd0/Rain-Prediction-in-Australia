# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia
For your project, you will use a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology , clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Alternatively, you can download your data from here. 

# Data
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from [http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01).

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at [https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData](https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01)


# You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


# The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics, when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
